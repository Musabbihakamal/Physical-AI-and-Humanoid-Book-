## Detailed Theory

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional artificial intelligence systems that operate purely in digital domains to AI systems that interact with and learn from the physical world through robotic bodies. Embodied Intelligence is the concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's cognitive processes, its physical body, and its environment.

This book comprehensively covers the core topics required to understand and build embodied intelligence systems using modern robotics frameworks. All content follows ROS 2 Rolling/Humble conventions, Python PEP8 style, and platform-agnostic instructions for Linux, Jetson, and Cloud environments.
