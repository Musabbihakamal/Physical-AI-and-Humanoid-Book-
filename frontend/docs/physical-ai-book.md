# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book covers four essential modules required to understand and build embodied intelligence systems using modern robotics frameworks and AI integration.

## Four Core Modules

1. [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./physical-ai/module-1-ros2.md)
2. [Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)](./physical-ai/module-2-digital-twin.md)
3. [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](./physical-ai/module-3-ai-robot-brain.md)
4. [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Capstone Project](./physical-ai/module-4-vla-capstone.md)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this book, you will be able to:
- Implement robotics systems using ROS 2 and related frameworks
